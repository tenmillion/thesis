\subsection{Overview}
\label{overview}
Focal brain cooling is a potential method of treatment for epilepsy with many advantages over conventionally available methods, but the mechanism by which it suppresses seizures is unknown. The focus of this thesis is to explore the possible ways in which temperature affects epileptiform cortical activity, in order to determine the features that must be included in a simplified analytical model.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%INTRO%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Background}
\label{background}
 Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Over 1\% of the world population is estimated to be afflicted\cite{Sander1996}. Of these patients, approximately 20\% suffer from refractory epilepsy, i.e. they do not respond to treatment by existing anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs)\cite{Shorvon1996}.

Conventionally, refractory epilepsy has been treated with surgery, such as resection of epileptic foci and transsection of neural fiber connecting epileptic foci with other areas of the brain. However, surgery is a highly invasive procedure accompanied by risk of infection and irreversible side effects, and there is a demand for less invasive, reversible alternatives.

Cooling of the epileptic focus is a promising new method for suppression of focal epileptic seizures, combining high efficacy and reversibility with low invasiveness. In an animal model of focal epilepsy, cooling the patch of cortex around an epileptic focus to 20$^\circ$C reduced the frequency of occurrence of seizures to 60\% of baseline (37$^\circ$C), and further cooling to 15$^\circ$C reduced it to 5\% of baseline\cite{Fujii2012}. Cooling of the cortex to as low as 0$^\circ$C for 1 hour leaves no histological damage in the tissue\cite{Oku2009}, and behavioral tests of motor performance during cooling of motor areas have shown that cooling of the cortex to as low as 15$^\circ$C has minimal effects on normal brain function\cite{Fujii2012}. Furthermore, compact cooling devices that can be embedded intracranially to minimize risk of infection are currently in development\cite{Fujii2012,Rothman2005}. Despite these recent advances in research toward the clinical application of brain cooling, the mechanism by which cooling suppresses seizures has remained poorly understood.

We may assume that cooling of the brain acts on seizures through some temperature-dependent process(es) in the brain. Many biophysical reactions in the nervous system depend on temperature. For example, membrane ion channels generally have temperature-dependent opening rates, as characterized in the classical Hodgkin-Huxley model\cite{Hodgkin1952}. Presynaptic terminals also change their release rate of neurotransmitters in response to temperature change\cite{Volgushev2004}. However, although experimental data is still scarce, the known temperature dependence of the presynaptic neurotransmitter release rate is relatively small, with its temperature coefficient $Q_{10}$ ranging mostly around 1 with the maximum around 2, compared to $Q_{10}\approx3$ in typical Hodgkin-Huxley-type ion channels\cite{Janssen1992}. A subtype of ion channels, known as temperature-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, show an even steeper temperature dependence than typical Hodgkin-Huxley-type ion channels, with the $Q_{10}$ of their opening or closing rates ranging from 9.4 to 14.8\cite{Voets2004}. They are found in cell membranes throughout the central nervous system\cite{Liapi2005}, as well as in heat or cold receptors in the peripheral nervous system. However, a recent study using TRP channel blockers failed to demonstrate their involvement in the suppression of epileptic seizures during cooling\cite{Motamedi2012}. Hodgkin-Huxley-type ion channels are therefore likely candidates for the molecular mechanism that cooling acts on to suppress epileptic seizures.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%INTRO%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Objectives}
\label{objectives}

The current study is a precursor to an analytical study of a simplified population model. Our goal for this study is to find the features that must be modeled in the simplified model, through an exploration of the effects of temperature on the function of a cortical network.

More specifically, we will focus on the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item At what temperature does the network stop firing continuously in response to transient input?
\item Can a network of neurons showing synchronous activity be desynchronized by cooling?
\item Is the transition from a state of epileptiform activity to a quiescent state continuous or discontinuous?
\end{enumerate}
The first question seeks to determine whether ion channel dynamics is a plausible mechanism for seizure suppression, by comparing the temperature of suppression of neural activity between simulation and experiment. The second and third questions pertain to the preservation of ``normal'' neural activity during cooling. It has been suggested that the preservation of normal motor function during cooling is due to the sharp dropoff of cooling below the cortical surface, with the deeper layers of cortex (layers V/VI) remaining at near-normal temperatures\cite{Fujii2012}. However, if moderate cooling ($\approx20^\circ$C) of seizing cortex produces asynchronous activity, the preservation of normal brain function can be explained as the effect of cooling alone, rather than an uneven distribution of cooling. Based on recent measurements of cortical local field potentials in human patients during epileptic seizures\cite{Schevon2012}, we will define ``epileptiform'' activity to be synchronized and oscillatory.

To address these questions, we will construct a detailed neuronal network model of mammalian cortex showing epileptiform activity, modeling the network's temperature dependence exclusively through the gating dynamics of its membrane conductances (corresponding to ion channels). Then, we will simulate different levels of cooling on this model to investigate whether the epileptiform activity stops at lower temperatures, and to characterize the network's transition from the epileptiform state to the quiescent state.

\section{Methods}
\label{methods}

\subsection{Overview of the Network Model}
\label{model}

A model of mammalian cortex was constructed, roughly based on Bush et al.'s model of epileptiform discharges following traumatic brain injury\cite{Bush1999}. 500 neurons with Hodgkin-Huxley-type membrane conductances (corresponding to ion channels) were coupled to one another through conductance-based synapses, to form a network, and their activity for 500 ms was simulated.


There were two types, or subpopulations, of neurons in the network: inhibitory and excitatory. The ratio of inhibitory to excitatory neurons was 1:4, based on a measurement in cat visual cortex\cite{Gabbott1986}. Each inhibitory and excitatory neuron consisted of 7 and 8 compartments, respectively. All compartments contained passive leakage membrane conductances. Only the compartment corresponding to the soma of each neuron contained active membrane conductances. Within each cell, the compartments were coupled through axial conductances. The dimensions of the compartments were the same as those used in \cite{Bush1996} for the inhibitory neurons and the layer II pyramidal neurons in\cite{Bush1993} for the excitatory neurons.

\begin{figure}[here]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{schematic.eps}
\caption{Schematic of the network}
\label{fig:diagram}
\end{figure}

The neurons were randomly interconnected as shown in Figure \ref{fig:diagram}, with each neuron receiving synaptic input from exactly 1/10 of each subpopulation of neurons (i.e. 10 inhibitory inputs and 40 excitatory inputs). No spatial relationship between the neurons was taken into account. In addition to this recurrent input, 1/10 of each subpopulation of neurons received excitatory input from an extrinsic source that produced a single pulse at 50 ms after the start of the simulation.

The membrane voltage $V^j$ of compartment $j$ in the network obeyed the ordinary differential equation
$$ C \frac{dV^j}{dt} = I^j_{memb} + I^j_{ax} + I^j_{syn}, $$
where $C$ is the membrane capacitance, and $I^j_{memb}$, $I^j_{ax}$ and $I^j_{syn}$ are the membrane, axial and synaptic currents into this compartment, respectively.

For a somatic compartment, $I^j_{memb}$ consisted of the typical Hodgkin-Huxley ion currents, i.e.
$$I^j_{memb} = g_L (E_L - V^j) + \overline{g}_{Na} m^3 h (E_{Na} - V^j) + \overline{g}_K n^4 (E_K - V^j),$$
where $E_L$, $E_{Na}$ and $E_K$ are the reversal potentials for the leakage current and each ion species, $g_L$ is the fixed leakage conductance, $\overline{g}_{Na}$ and $\overline{g}_K$ are the maximum conductances for the ion channels (Table \ref{table:membrane}), and $m$, $h$ and $n$ are voltage-\ and temperature-dependent gating variables, described in \ref{epi}. The parameters were taken from \cite{Bush1994}. For the dendritic compartments, $I^j_{memb}$ lacked the sodium and potassium ion currents.

$I^j_{ax}$ was simply the sum of the currents from all neighboring compartments. The axial current from compartment $k$ to compartment $j$ is given by
$$I^{k,j}_{ax} = \gamma (V^j-V^k),$$
where $\gamma$ is the axial conductance between compartment $k$ and $j$, assumed constant for all $k$ and $j$.

$I^j_{syn}$ was the linear weighted sum of the currents from incoming synaptic connections. The synaptic current from somatic compartment $i$ to compartment $j$ is given by 
$$I^{i,j}_{syn} = g_{syn}^{i,j} (V^j-E_{syn}),$$
where $g_{syn}^{i,j}$ is the conductance of the postsynaptic ion channel, and $E_{syn}$ is the reversal potential of the ion species used by the channel. In response to the arrival of an action potential at the presynaptic compartment at time $t$, $g_{syn}^{i,j}$ changed according to the alpha function
$$g_{syn}^{i,j}=\tau_A(t-D^{i,j}) \exp(1-\tau_B(t-D^{i,j})),$$
where $\tau_A$ and $\tau_B$ are the opening and closing time constants for the postsynaptic ion channel, specified for each type of synapse, and $D^{i,j}$ is the synaptic delay for synapse ($i,j$). This delay was assigned randomly to each synapse according to a normal distribution, and remained fixed for all simulations. The temperature dependencde of the synaptic currents was not modeled.

We included four types of synapses in our model, representing synapses gated by four different types of neurotransmitters: AMPA and NMDA, which are excitatory, and GABA$_A$ and GABA$_B$, which are inhibitory. The types of synapses differed in their time constants $\tau_A$ and $\tau_B$, and their reversal potentials $E_{syn}$ (Table \ref{table:synapse}). Excitatory neurons made AMPA synapses on inhibitory neurons, and an inhibitory neuron made either GABA$_A$ or GABA$_B$ synapses on an excitatory neuron. A synaptic connection between two excitatory neurons could be either AMPAergic or NMDAergic. All extrinsic input was AMPAergic. Synapses between inhibitory neurons were not included in the model.

The weights of the synaptic inputs were randomly assigned according to normal distributions specific to each type of synapse (Table \ref{table:synapse}), with the variances set to 1/2 of the mean values.

%At which compartments did the neurons receive synaptic input?

\subsection{Modeling of Epileptic Seizures}
\label{epi}
In our simulations, we used a model of epileptic seizures based on disinhibition\cite{Macdonald1978}. As experimental measurements of synaptic conductances giving rise to epilepsy were scarce, preliminary simulations were conducted to determine the range of $w_{GA}$ to be simulated. At 37$^\circ$C, setting the mean GABA$_A$ weight to $w_{GA}\ge4\mathrm{[nS]}$ produced only a transient response to the initial extrinsic input, with no subsequent activity. Mean values of $w_{GA}<4\mathrm{[nS]}$ produced further firing that quickly ($<150$ms) spread to the entire network, triggering sustained synchronized oscillations. Thus, we used $w_{GA}=4\mathrm{[nS]}$ as the baseline, and examined the effects of cooling on network activity at lower mean values of $w_{GA}$.

\subsection{Modeling of Temperature Dependence and Cooling}
\label{temp}
In order to investigate whether ion channels might be responsible for the suppression of epileptic seizures during cooling, temperature dependence of neural activity in our model was modeled only through the non-post-synaptic membrane conductances. Specifically, the rate of change of the gating variables of the conductances was made to be temperature-dependent. The gating variables $m$, $h$ and $n$ evolved over time according to
\begin{eqnarray*}
\phi \frac{dm}{dt}= \alpha_m(V)(1-m)-\beta_m(V)m\\
\phi \frac{dh}{dt}= \alpha_h(V)(1-h)-\beta_h(V)h\\
\phi \frac{dn}{dt}= \alpha_n(V)(1-n)-\beta_n(V)n
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\alpha(V)$ and $\beta(V)$ are the voltage-dependent opening (or activation for $h$) and closing (or inactivation for $h$) rates of the gates, respectively. The time constant $\phi$ was varied over temperature according to
$$\phi=Q_{10}^{(T-T_{exp})/10},$$
where $Q_{10}$ is the temperature coefficient, $T$ is the temperature of the simulation, $T_{exp}$ is the temperature in the experiment through which the parameters for $\alpha(V)$ and $\beta(V)$ were obtained. Intuitively, $\phi$ decreased threefold for every 10$^{\circ}$C decrease in temperature, which in turn slowed down the transition rates of all the gating variables simultaneously.

The temperature in the simulations was varied from normal body temperature (37$^\circ$C) to 10$^\circ$C in steps of 1$^\circ$C. Within each trial, temperature was kept constant throughout the simulation.

\subsection{Simulation Environment}
\label{environment}

The simulation was constructed and run on NEURON, a platform for simulation of neuonal networks best suited for physiologically detailed models. For the integration of the coupled differential equations for membrane voltage, the backward Euler method with a time step of 0.01 ms was used. This time step is sufficient to model action potentials, which occur on orders of milliseconds.

\section{Results}
\label{results}

\subsection{Suppression of Oscillatory Activity at Lower Temperatures}
\label{suppression}
To explore the response of seizing cortex to cooling, we simulated the activity of a network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons following a single transient input, at a wide range of temperatures and synaptic weight values.

We found that, when the GABA$_A$ synaptic weight was set to $w_{GA}=0.6$ $\times$ baseline, which produced an epileptiform, sustained oscillation at 37$^\circ$C, no sustained oscillation was produced below 16$^\circ$C. In general, at lower temperatures, smaller values of $w_{GA}$ were needed for the same extrinsic input to trigger sustained oscillations (Figure \ref{fig:plots}).

Transition from the epileptiform state to the quiescent state was abrupt; for $w_{GA}=0.6$ $\times$ baseline, the oscillation frequency dropped from about 40Hz at 17$^\circ$C to 0Hz at 16$^\circ$C. Similar results were obtained for the entire range of parameters tested (Figure \ref{fig:plots}). Furthermore, for all parameter values tested, any sustained activity was synchronous and oscillatory; no asynchronous or irregularly firing state was found.

\begin{landscape}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.5\textheight]{plots.eps}
\caption{Network activity for the parameter values simulated}
\label{fig:plots}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

%Within the range of temperatures where oscillatory activity was observed, the frequency of the population oscillation generally decreased with temperature. However, contrary to our expectations, the decrease was non-monotonic. In particular, there was a rise in oscillation frequency from 37$^\circ$C to around 25$^\circ$C, in most of the range of $w_{GA}$ tested.

\subsection{Non-Monotonic Relationship between Oscillatory Activity and Temperature}
\label{nonmonotonic}
Interestingly, when the simulations were run at the baseline $w_{GA}$ value, which did not produce any persistent oscillatory activity at 37$^\circ$C, oscillatory activity appeared between 24$^\circ$C and 35$^\circ$C. Simulations run at values of $w_{GA}$ above baseline revealed that there was an intermediate range of $w_{GA}$ (0.8$\times$ baseline $< w_{GA} <$ 1.6 $\times$ baseline) in which oscillations occurred only during moderate cooling (around 25$^\circ$C to 35$^\circ$C). Higher values of $w_{GA}$ suppressed oscillatory activity for all temperatures, whereas lower values of $w_{GA}$ produced oscillatory activity for all temperatures higher than the threshold where oscillations first occurred.

\section{Discussion}
\label{discussion}

\subsection{Suppression of Epileptiform Activity During Cooling}
\label{termination}

Our goal in this study was to explore and characterize the effects of cooling on epileptiform activity in cortex. In particular, we sought to determine whether ion channels were a plausible target of action for cooling to suppress epileptic seizures. Our results indicate that cooling can indeed suppress epileptiform activity by acting only on the state transition rates of ion channels.

To our surprise, we found that moderate cooling actually produced, rather than suppress, oscillatory activity at intermediate levels of inhibition. This may be due to the non-monotonous temperature-frequency curve of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron near bifurcation \cite{Sato2012}. At intermediate levels of inhibition, between the all-firing and all-quiescent regions in parameter space, the individual neurons in the network are presumably close to their bifurcation point with respect to input current. Thus, at these parameter values, lowering the temperature may increase network activity at some temperatures.

\subsection{Preservation of Normal Activity During Cooling}
\label{normal}

We were also interested in whether cooling of seizing cortex can produce states of low firing rate and asynchronous activity, such as can be seen in normal resting-state cortex. However, no such states were observed for any temperature, at least within the range of parameters we explored. This does not conflict with the hypothesis that preservation of normal activity during cooling of the cortical surface is due to the deeper layers of the cortex being kept near their normal temperature.

However, it is still possible that for a set of parameters we did not try in our simulations, cooling of the seizing network to certain temperatures produces low-firing-rate, non-oscillatory and/or asynchronous output. One way in which such intermediate states may be produced is by changing the distribution of the synaptic weights. In actual cortex, synaptic weights may obey a log-normal distribution, characterized by a small number of very strong connections and a majority of very weak connections\cite{Song2005}. A recent modeling study showed that a network with a small number of strong connections (enough to trigger action potentials on their own) and a large number of weak connections can maintain low-frequency, asynchronous activity following transient input, whereas a network with the conventional all-weak connections requires sustained input in order to maintain such asynchronous firing\cite{Teramae2012}. This is because in a network with only weak connections, a large number of simultaneous inputs is required to trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron, and thus any self-sustained activity must be either synchronized and oscillatory or have very high individual firing rate.

\subsection{Limitations of the Current Study and Future Work}
\label{simplify}
 The limitations of our current model are its large degree of freedom and high complexity. With thousands of parameters and interacting variables, not only is it a challenge to evaluate the dependence of the model on the parameter values, but it is also difficult to understand in what way the change in ion channel properties gives rise to the change in network activity.

A more thorough search through the parameter space is necessary. In doing so, the simulation parameters, such as the synaptic weights and the change in ion channel state transition rates over temperature, must be constrained further with experimental data. The simulation results must also be validated against recordings of population activity at different temperatures and concentrations of convulsants. Such data are scarce and must be collected through both in vitro and in vivo experiments.

In addition to the opening rates of ion channels, the effects of other temperature-dependent factors, such as neurotransmitter release at presynaptic terminals, must be considered, in order to identify the factors that contribute most to seizure suppression. Including the other temperature-dependent factors may also enable low-activity states to appear at some temperatures.

A simplified model would be useful for a more systematic analysis of the parameter dependence of the model. A mean-field approximation of the network (for example, \cite{Brunel2000}), in which the states of the network are reduced to the evolution of a distribution of membrane voltage over time, would allow us to analytically locate the boundaries in parameter space between the different states.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}
In the present work, we demonstrated through simulations of a network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons that the temperature dependence of ion channels can explain the suppression of seizures by cooling.

Over the entire range of temperatures and GABA$_A$ weights simulated, the network entered either an epileptiform, synchronized oscillatory state or a quiescent state in response to transient extrinsic input. While our search through parameter space was by no means exhaustive, the results lend credibility to the hypothesis that normal cortical function is preserved during cooling because the deeper layers of cortex remain uncooled, rather than because of the normal activities themselves being preserved throughout the cortex during cooling.

Further work is required to rule out the possibility that these results are not specific to the parameter values used in our simulations, as well as to validate them quantitatively against experimental data.
